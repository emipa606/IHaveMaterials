You can always place blueprints, even if you have no materials.

The materials are configurable, but by default it forces wood, steel, cloth, and any stone type found naturally in the current map to act as if you have some.

Compatibility:
Does not make any changes to your save file. Safe to add or remove at any time.
Conflicts with other mods that replace the Designator_Build.ProcessInput function. (I am not currently aware of any.)
